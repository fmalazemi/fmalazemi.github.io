# Part 3: Debugging Gem5
Gem5 includes debugging support to print messages according to a specific flag. You can define as many flags as you want. 

## Run with debug flag `f`
```
build/X86/gem5.debug --debug-flags=f configs/configration.py 
```

## Add a new debugging flag `newFlag`
Let use say, you want to use `newFlag` in `src/temp/temp.cc`, 2 steps are required:  
1. Add the following include statement to `temp.cc`
```
#include "debug/newFlag.hh"
```
2. Register the new flag `newFlag` in `src/temp/sconscript` by adding the following:
```
DebugFlag('Hello')
```
Now you can use Gem5 debugging prints in temp.cc by adding the following any where in the code
```
DPRINTF(newFlag, "print Message\n");
```

## Run Gem5 with debugging flag `f` 
```
build/X86/gem5.opt --debug-flags=DRAM configs/configration.py 
```
This 

# `assert` and `printf` 

# `gdp`
